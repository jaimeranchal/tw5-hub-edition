This is the main entry point to your wiki. From here you //should// be able to:

* View the ''main categories''
* Do some ''basic actions'' (create new tids, check sth. etc)

! 🎏 ToDo

<div class="list-wrapper">
<<checklist mode:sort>>
</div>

! 🧮 Tabs

For each category defined you should see two tabs:

<div class="list-wrapper">

* a ''overview'' tab listing all tiddlers tagged with the corresponding category. Could be a table, a list, as you wish.
* a ''create'' tab with a form to add new items.

</div>

! 🚧 Modding

This template includes various plugins that can be further customised if needed. Most of them come from [[Mohammand|https://kookma.github.io/TW-Resources/]].
